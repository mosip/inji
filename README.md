Inji - Means knowing or recognizance in [Korean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_language)

Inji is a reference app and provides most of the necessary components to act as a wallet.

Inji stands as a secure, trustworthy, and dependable mobile Verifiable Credentials wallet designed to fulfil the following functions:

1. Download and store Verifiable credentials (VC) securely within the wallet.
2. Conduct offline face authentication against the stored VCs to verify the user's presence
3. Share Verifiable credentials with relying parties without requiring an internet connection, utilizing Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE).
4. Enable users to log in to online portals of relying parties by scanning a QR code, facilitating seamless access to their services.

The application is constructed using the [React Native framework](https://reactnative.dev/), ensuring compatibility with both Android and iOS mobile operating systems.

It leverages [Xstate state machines](https://xstate.js.org/docs/) for efficient application state management. The digital credentials produced by the mobile app adhere to the [Verifiable Credentials (VC) Data Model](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/).
